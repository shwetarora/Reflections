How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

I don't know I didn't understand how to use diff

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

You can refer to an earlier working version or revert to older version at any point in time.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

You can control version control. Just enough nbr of commits. However, left to judgement call may forget to commit

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

GIT deals with code where most of the time files are closely inter-related. While Google Docs maintain version of mostly independent documents

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

git log will provide ID and history of all commits. git diff will help see the difference beween two commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

you could always revert to a previous version

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

Version control..
